<h3>Waist-Height Ratio</h3>
			<hr class="colorgraph"></hr>
		
		<p>The Waist-Height Ratio (WHtR) is a recently introduced index which is under study as a sensitive screening tool in predicting cardiometabolic risk of adults from different nations. Its key message can be simply stated as to: "keep your waist circumference to less than half your height". </p>

<p>WHtR is a simple and practical anthropometric index to identify higher metabolic risks among normal and overweight individuals (Hsieh, 2003)</p>

<p>A boundary value of WHTR =0.5 indicates increased risk for men and women (Ashwell and Hsieh, 2005).</p>

<p>It is suggested that WHtR should not be used as a single measure of obesity but it can be used in combination with other screening tools like waist circumference and body mass index.</p><br><br>
