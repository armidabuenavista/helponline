					<p style="text-align: justify;">A calorie is a unit of energy. In our daily lives, we often relate it with two common activities which are 1) energy consumption through eating and drinking and 2) energy usage through physical activity. Moreover, the word, calorie, is usually found in food labels shown as kilocalorie(s) or kcal. Calories are found in fats, carbohydrates, proteins and alcohol and anything that contains energy.  </p>
