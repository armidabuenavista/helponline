					<p style=" text-align: justify;"><strong>Energy requirement</strong> is the amount of food energy needed to balance energy intake and energy expenditure in order to maintain body size, body composition and a level of necessary and desirable physical activity consistent with long-term good health. This includes the energy needed for the optimal growth and development of children, for the deposition of tissues during pregnancy, and for the secretion of milk during lactation consistent with the good health of mother and child.</p>
